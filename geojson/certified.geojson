He and his sons Giorgos and Panagiotis are specialised in growing the late-ripening varieties Lane Late and Valencia, which can be harvested well into midsummer and which are also distributed via a biocyclic vegan fruit box scheme. In this way the flourishing of their orange groves is an important contribution to the spread of biocyclic vegan agriculture in the region and beyond throughout Greece and even abroad."
