In 1998 they decided to develop an organic vegetable production cultivating a great variety of vegetables suitable for the cold humid mountain climate. Together with other small farms in the region, they obtained the first organic certification awarded in Colombia in 2000. They have their own delivery infrastructure and sell to local restaurants and hotel chains. They also deliver their vegetables to many individuals and families in the city of Bogota.\n\nFinca Villa Paz is currently preparing for biocyclic vegan certification."
